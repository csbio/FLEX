# FLEX (FunctionaL Evaluation of eXperimental perturbations)

We present FLEX (Functionalevaluation of experimental perturbations), a pipeline that leverages severalfunctional annotation resourcesto establish reference standards for benchmarking human genome-wide CRISPR screen data and methods for analyzing them. We apply FLEX to analyze data from the diverse cell line screens generated by the DepMap project. We identify a dominant mitochondria-associated signal, which our time-resolved CRISPR screens and analysis suggests may reflect screen dynamics and protein stability effects rather than genetic dependencies.

The github R package for FLEX is located here: https://github.com/csbio/FLEX_R
