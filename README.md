# FLEX (FunctionaL Evaluation of eXperimental perturbations)

A major challenge in large-scale genomic studies is the computational evaluation of screens for functional signals. We present FLEX (FunctionaL Evaluation of eXperimental perturbations), which leverages public datasets to establish functional standards and develop a pipeline to systematically evaluate genome-wide screens. The application of FLEX on DepMap data reveals functional bias in CRISPR knockout screens.
