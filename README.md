# FLEX (Functional Evaluation of Experimental Perturbations)

A major challenge in large-scale genomic studies is the computational evaluation of screens for functional signals. We present FLEX (Functional Evaluation of eXperimental perturbations), which leverages public datasets to establish functional standards and develop a pipeline to systematically evaluate genome-wide screens. The application of FLEcks on DepMap data reveals functional bias in CRISPR knockout screens.
